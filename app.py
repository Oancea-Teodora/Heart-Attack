        Documentation: Input Data Guide
        1. Age
        The age of the person in years. Heart attack risk increases with age.
        
        Valid Range: [1, 120]
        
        2. Sex
        0: Female, 1: Male. Men are generally at higher risk, especially at younger ages.
        
        Valid Range: [0, 1]
        
        3. Chest Pain Type (CP)
        Chest pain types indicate the nature of heart-related discomfort.
        
        0: Asymptomatic â€“ No symptoms
        1: Typical Angina â€“ Pain with exertion
        2: Atypical Angina â€“ Pain without exertion
        3: Non-anginal Pain â€“ Pain not related to the heart
        Valid Range: [0, 3]
        
        4. Maximum Heart Rate (Thalach)
        The highest heart rate achieved during exercise. A lower rate can indicate heart issues.
        
        Valid Range: [60, 200] (Average: 160 bpm)
        
        5. Exercise-Induced Angina (Exang)
        0: No angina, 1: Angina during exercise. Chest pain during exercise can indicate blocked arteries.
        
        Valid Range: [0, 1]
        
        6. ST Segment Slope (Slope)
        Indicates the slope of the ST segment during exercise.
        
        0: Downsloping â€“ Sign of worsening heart conditions
        1: Flat â€“ Possible concern
        2: Upsloping â€“ Typically normal
        Valid Range: [0, 2]
        
        7. Major Vessels (Ca)
        Number of major coronary arteries (0-3) visible via imaging. More vessels visible often means higher risk.
        
        Valid Range: [0, 3]
        
        8. Thalassemia (Thal)
        Indicates the type of thalassemia.
        
        1: Fixed Defect â€“ Permanent heart defect
        2: Normal â€“ No defect
        3: Reversible Defect â€“ Temporary heart issue under stress
        Valid Range: [1, 3]
        
        9. Resting Blood Pressure (Trtbps)
        The person's blood pressure at rest. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease.
        
        Valid Range: [90, 180] mm Hg (Average: 120 mm Hg)
        
        10. ST Depression (Oldpeak)
        Indicates ST depression during exercise compared to rest. Higher values can indicate poor blood flow to the heart.
        
        Valid Range: [0.0, 5.0]
